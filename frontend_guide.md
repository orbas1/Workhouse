# Frontend Guide

This guide outlines the structure and conventions used by the React application in the `frontend/` workspace. It serves as a starting point for contributors and a reference for future maintenance.

## Directory Layout
- `admin/` – admin specific pages and components.
- `api/` – thin wrappers around backend API calls.
- `components/` – shared UI building blocks built with Chakra UI.
- `context/` – React context providers for global state such as authentication and theming.
- `pages/` – top level route components rendered by React Router.
- `public/` – static assets copied as is to the final build.
- `scripts/` – node utilities for testing and building with Vite.

## Styling
Chakra UI is the primary styling solution. Component level styles are preferred over global CSS. When custom styles are required use CSS modules or inline `sx` props.

## State Management
React context covers global state. Local component state should be kept minimal and lifted up only when required. Avoid prop drilling by creating domain specific providers.

## API Access
All network requests go through the helpers in `api/`. These functions use `axios` and automatically apply the base URL from `env.js`. New endpoints should expose a descriptive wrapper that returns the parsed response.

## Routing
Routes are defined in `pages/` and composed in `App.jsx`. Keep routes shallow; nested routes should map closely to the sidebar navigation.

## Testing
Vitest is used for unit testing. Place tests alongside the components they cover with the `.test.jsx` or `.test.js` suffix. Run the suite with:

```bash
npm test --workspace frontend
```

## Development Workflow
1. Install dependencies from the repository root: `npm install`.
2. Start the dev server: `npm run start:frontend`.
3. The frontend expects the backend API to be available. Configure `VITE_API_URL` in `.env`.
4. Commit user facing changes with accompanying tests and documentation updates.

## Build
Production builds are generated by Vite:

```bash
npm run build --workspace frontend
```

The compiled output lands in `frontend/dist/` and is served by `app.js` when running the combined server.

## Coding Standards
- Use ES6 modules and modern React patterns.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer function components and hooks.
- Document complex logic with inline comments.

## Future Enhancements
The `agents.md` roadmap tracks high level frontend milestones such as navigation redesign and setup wizard implementation. Any substantial UI work should update this guide accordingly.
