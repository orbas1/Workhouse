# Backend Development Stages

1. **Controller Module**
   - Implement controllers to handle domains described in `backend_guide.md`, such as affiliate program management, agency profiles, and other service areas.
   - Each controller should validate input, manage business logic delegation, and send consistent JSON responses.
   - Include error handling and authentication checks where required.

2. **Database Module**
   - Configure database connection settings (e.g., MongoDB URI, pooling) and ensure secure credential management through environment variables.
   - Plan database structure to support entities like affiliates, agencies, jobs, users, and payments as outlined in the guide.
   - Establish indexing and migration strategies for scalability and performance.

3. **Model Module**
   - Define schema models for core entities referenced in the backend guide.
   - Specify field types, validation rules, and relationships among entities (e.g., agencies to employees, affiliates to payouts).
   - Include default values and schema methods to encapsulate common logic.

4. **Route Module**
   - Create RESTful routes that map HTTP endpoints to controller actions for all domains in the guide.
   - Organize routes logically, grouping by feature (affiliate, agency, user, etc.) and apply middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and input sanitization.
   - Ensure versioning strategy for future API changes.

5. **Service Module**
   - Implement reusable service layers to encapsulate business logic such as commission calculations, job matchmaking, and notification handling.
   - Services should interact with models and external APIs, keeping controllers lightweight.
   - Write unit tests for service methods to ensure correctness.

6. **Application Entry Module**
   - Integrate all modules in `backend/app.js`, wiring up middleware, connecting to the database, and mounting routes.
   - Configure global error handling, logging, and configuration loading.
   - Ensure the server starts and shuts down gracefully.
