# Update Plan

This plan provides nearâ€‘term development goals derived from the broader roadmap in `agents.md`.

## Backend Foundation
- Integrate frontend and backend under the unified `app.js` server.
- Add database migrations and seeding scripts.
- Introduce automated tests for critical services.

## Frontend Integration
- Redesign navigation and menus for clarity.
- Implement an initial setup wizard for administrators.
- Ensure responsive layouts across core pages.

## Containerization
- Finalize Docker image for local development and production parity.
- Provide examples for launching a shell inside the container.

## Deployment

- Prepare CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

Progress should be tracked in `CHANGELOG.md` and tasks broken down into issues for collaboration.
